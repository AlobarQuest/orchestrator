# Code Quality (code-standards layer)

Standards reference: `~/Developer/code-standards/STANDARDS.md`

## Before writing a cross-cutting pattern — query Code Brain

Before implementing a recurring cross-cutting concern (logging, error handling,
auth, notifications, API conventions, secrets, …), query **Code Brain** — the
machine source of record for our paved roads — and follow its rules:

- `get_road("<slug>")` → the decided approach + rules + exemplars, or
- `get_rules(severity="BLOCK")` → the must-follow rules.

Do **not** infer the standard from existing code; it may predate the standard.
When you decide a new cross-cutting pattern, write it back (`add_road` / `add_rule`).

## Before declaring a non-trivial change done

1. Run `make check` — full-repo lint, type-check, and tests must be green.
2. Run `/code-review` — review the diff for correctness bugs and simplification opportunities.

Both gates apply to any change that touches logic, interfaces, or configuration.
Trivial fixes (typos, comment edits) may skip `/code-review` at your discretion.

## Enforcement

A diff-scoped Stop hook enforces this automatically: it runs the linters over your
changed files when the session ends and blocks completion if new violations are
introduced. Existing baseline violations are tracked and do not block.

## Canonical example module

The authoritative pattern for this repo's style is:

the cleanest, most idiomatic existing module in this repo

When writing new code, mirror the structure, naming conventions, and documentation
style of that module.

## Known Non-obvious Invariants

- **Everything in this section must stay BELOW `<!-- code-standards:end -->`.**
  `code_standards.stanza.inject_stanza` replaces the whole `start`…`end` block in
  place and preserves only what surrounds it, and the canonical stanza template
  contains no invariants section. Until 2026-07-09 these bullets lived *inside*
  the block, one `code-standards init`/`sync` away from silent deletion.
  Verify with: re-rendering the block over this file must be a no-op.
- On this machine, repo-local agent instructions live in `CLAUDE.md`. Treat
  `AGENTS.md` references from generic agent tooling as equivalent to checking
  `CLAUDE.md` unless a repo explicitly provides both files.
- Generic authority approvals satisfy work-unit readiness only. Authority-expanding
  standing-context updates require a named human approval bound to the exact
  standing-context fingerprint.
- Protocol smoke tests may manipulate time or lease expiry as deterministic fixture
  setup. Runtime recovery behavior itself must go through public API/CLI surfaces,
  not private service shortcuts.
- The default `make check` gate must resolve Python tools from the repo-local
  `.venv/bin` before global PATH. A global `pytest` can collect with the wrong
  interpreter and fail imports even when the uv-scoped suite is green.
- Local dogfooding must use a runtime database separate from `orchestrator_test`.
  The test fixtures intentionally drop and recreate the test database, so storing
  live orchestrator lifecycle state there will erase approved intake, decomposition,
  claims, and evidence during `make check`.
- Generated post-deploy acceptance criteria are verifier-owned. Public
  adjudication must reject generated post-deploy AC IDs, so post-deploy completion
  always flows through the WS-5.1 verifier evaluators and lifecycle guards.
- Production Coolify images must be amd64 or multi-arch. Local Apple Silicon
  Docker builds produce arm64 images by default; use `docker buildx build
  --platform linux/amd64 --push` or a multi-arch build for `sds.alobar.net`, and
  verify the running container image/digest after Coolify reports deployment
  finished.
- Production `/api` is M2M-only at the proxy: the Traefik dynamic config
  (`/data/coolify/proxy/dynamic/orchestrator.yaml` on the VPS) strips
  `X-authentik-*` headers from `/api` routes, so human-actor API routes are
  unreachable from a browser session unless a dedicated router applies the
  `/review` middleware chain (strip → Authentik forward-auth → proxy marker) to
  those paths — see the `orchestrator-promotion-human` router (WS-6.3). Quirk:
  the first same-origin POST behind forward-auth can return the app's 401
  (fetch follows the auth 302 and degrades to GET); the immediate retry works.
- Production observation ingestion requires an `ActorRole.SYSTEM` actor. The
  standing M2M credential is worker-role, so closeout-style observations use a
  temporary credential: merge into `ORCHESTRATOR_M2M_CREDENTIALS` + map it in
  `ORCHESTRATOR_M2M_ROLES`, restart, use, then revert. Verify EVERY env write
  landed before restarting — a roles entry without its matching credential
  fails startup validation closed and takes production down.
- Coolify's env PATCH endpoint intermittently 500s on this app; the reliable
  fallback is delete-by-env-uuid + recreate. All `/envs` API responses include
  `real_value` for every variable (DB URLs with passwords) — parse them
  in-process and print only whitelisted fields, never through ad-hoc shell
  pipelines.
- The work-unit authority envelope is a **cross-repo contract** with
  `AlobarQuest/factory-runner`, not a local data shape. It is pinned by a
  byte-identical `tests/fixtures/runner_authority_envelope.json` in both repos
  and the same `CONTRACT_SHA256` in `tests/contract/test_runner_envelope_contract.py`
  here and `tests/test_orchestrator_envelope_contract.py` there. Changing the
  envelope means changing both repos together; a one-sided edit fails the repo
  that was not updated. Before WS-6.4.0 no test crossed this boundary, and the
  two sides had silently diverged into mutually unsatisfiable fixtures.
- `AuthorityEnvelope.normalized()` defines what a human's authority approval
  actually attests. Fields outside `KNOWN_FIELDS` contribute only their *names*
  to the fingerprint, never their values — so a field carrying real authority
  (where code ships, which change class, what conformance was claimed) MUST be a
  known field. **Adding to `KNOWN_FIELDS` rewrites every authority fingerprint**,
  so its cost is proportional to the live ledger: free on 2026-07-09 (2 completed
  units, empty ledger), expensive later. No data migration is needed for existing
  units — every `authority_fingerprint()` call site is at write/activation time,
  and readiness compares stored columns rather than recomputing.
- factory-runner refuses to act unless `target_repo == current_repo`: it may only
  mutate the repository it checked out (`factory_runner/authority.py`). Dispatch
  must therefore resolve the target repository **per work unit**, from
  `authority.constraints.target_repository`, never from a process-global setting.
  A global target does not fail closed — it silently misroutes every fan-out unit
  to whichever repo was configured at process start.
- `src/orchestrator/kernel/` may not contain the string literal `dispatch`,
  `merge`, or other WS-4.2/mutation terms — `tests/architecture/test_ws32_scope_guards.py`
  scans runtime string literals, **including docstrings**, not just code.
- The **envelope contract and the workflow contract are different contracts.**
  WS-6.4.0's shared-fixture test validates the authority envelope across both
  repos and never executes the workflow. Two independent workflow bugs shipped
  under a green suite and blocked every dispatch until 2026-07-09: factory-runner
  was private (a reusable workflow called from repo X runs with X's
  `GITHUB_TOKEN`, so `uv tool install git+https://…` could not authenticate), and
  the workflow ran `./scripts/run-factory-task.sh`, which exists only in
  factory-runner's tree while `actions/checkout` checks out the **caller's** repo.
  A reusable workflow may only invoke things reachable from the caller's working
  directory — i.e. the installed console script. factory-runner is now public;
  keep it public or the install breaks again. Its Actions access policy was also
  `access_level: none`, so **no repo could call it at all** — that, not
  credentials, is why the pilot sat at "merged, credentialed, not dispatched".
- **`sds.alobar.net` is NOT Cloudflare-proxied** — it answers `server: uvicorn`
  behind Traefik directly. The portfolio-wide invariant that Cloudflare 403s
  default Python User-Agents with `error code: 1010` does **not** apply here;
  factory-runner's `httpx` default UA authenticates fine (verified from a
  GitHub-hosted runner, 2026-07-09). Do not misdiagnose a failure here as that.
- **Write `ORCHESTRATOR_M2M_CREDENTIALS` before `ORCHESTRATOR_M2M_ROLES`, and
  verify each from inside the container before the next restart.** `main.py`
  raises when `set(roles) ⊄ set(credentials)` — it fails **closed**, so the
  container will not boot. A half-applied credentials write leaves roles absent,
  which is a healthy configuration; a half-applied roles write is an outage (this
  is the WS-6.3 ~3-minute 503). There is no ordering of the two that can strand
  production, at the cost of one extra restart. Never "save a restart".
- The registry bundle is built from the **git tree** at `SECURITY_STANDARDS_REVISION`,
  not from a working copy, and is baked into the image. A credential's `agent_id`
  must resolve to an actor in that bundle, and `ActorContext(identity.actor_id, role)`
  means **every event is attributed to that `agent_id` forever**. Adding an actor
  therefore requires a merged security-standards commit plus an image rebuild —
  never borrow an unrelated identity for a durable credential. `token_hash` is
  `sha256(bearer_token)`; Coolify stores only the hash, so the hash is safe to
  handle and the token must never leave BWS.
- **`make check` exit 0 does not prove the tests ran.** The vendored Makefile runs
  `pytest; rc=$$?; if [ $$rc -ne 0 ] && [ $$rc -ne 5 ]; then exit $$rc; fi` — exit
  code **5 means "no tests collected"** and is deliberately swallowed so a TS-only
  repo can share the target. A misconfigured `testpaths`, a collection error in a
  `conftest.py`, or a tool resolved from the wrong venv can therefore produce a
  green `make check` having executed nothing. Read the collected-test count, in CI
  as well as locally (`collected N items`), not just the exit code. This is the
  local twin of the portfolio-wide invariant that `uv sync` installs no extras and
  `quality.yml` guards every tool with `command -v`.
- **`constraints.allowed_commands` is an ordered command list the worker re-executes,
  not a permission set.** `finalize-run` runs **every** entry, in envelope order,
  and only then checks `git status` before committing. So (a) anything authorized
  *will* run again at finalize — there is no coding-phase-only grant; and (b) a
  mutator listed after the verifier means the recorded evidence (`"make check:
  passed"`) attests to a tree that is not the one pushed. Order mutators first,
  the verifier last.
- **An envelope that authorizes no mutating command cannot produce a diff, and the
  authority approval that blessed it cannot be taken back.** `approve_decomposition_proposal`
  raises `decomposition_already_approved` while an `ApprovedDecomposition` has
  `superseded_at IS NULL`, no supersede route is exposed, and unit `authority` has no
  mutation path — so a wrong envelope costs a whole new package revision plus a fresh
  human approval per unit. Before spending any of that, dry-run each unit against its
  real target repo, read-only: prove the mutator yields a diff (`uv lock --upgrade
  --dry-run`, `npm outdated`) and prove the verifier actually executes tools (no
  `"… not installed — skipping"`, a real `collected N items`). Verifying a manifest's
  *type* is not verifying an upgrade is *available*: a `==` pin makes `uv lock
  --upgrade` a silent no-op, and the unit then dies on the same `no changes to submit`
  guard the envelope was rewritten to avoid. The general failure is **authored intent
  never validated against executable reality**; WS-6.4 hit it three times.
- **That dry-run rule is necessary but NOT sufficient — it passed all three WS-6.4 defects.**
  Add three clauses. (1) **Run the ordered list twice** in one checkout: `finalize-run`
  re-executes every `allowed_commands` entry before `git status`, and `uv venv` is not
  idempotent (`uv venv --clear` is). (2) **Name every site of a pin**: `uv` resolves
  `[dependency-groups]` and `[project.optional-dependencies]` jointly, so bumping one of
  two identical `==` pins is *unsatisfiable*, not merely inconsistent. (3) **Control for
  the environment** — run the verifier against an *unmodified* clean clone first, or a
  runner-environment failure reads as an update-induced one.
- **`make check` cannot pass on a bare runner: it needs Postgres, `SECURITY_STANDARDS_DIR`,
  and a migrated database.** `tests/conftest.py` connects to `127.0.0.1:5432`, and
  `factory_events` (which lives in `security-standards`, not in this repo's dependencies)
  is importable only via `SECURITY_STANDARDS_DIR` pointing at
  `tests/fixtures/security-standards`. `quality.yml` supplies a `postgres:16-alpine`
  service, both DB URLs, that env var, and a prior `alembic upgrade head`;
  `factory-runner-pilot.yml` supplies none of them. A clean clone in a bare environment
  fails `18 failed, 836 passed` with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'factory_events'`
  — *unmodified*, so this is never evidence a dependency update broke anything.
  Consequently **`make check` must never appear in this repo's authority envelope**: with
  no `.venv` it exits 0 having verified nothing, and with one it hard-fails at finalize.
  Its envelope verifies `uv sync` + `uv lock --check`; its tests are gated by its own
  named check on the pull-request head, which is where AC-001..006 already place that
  evidence. **Exit 0 from `make check` is never proof tests ran — read the collected count.**

- **A service that FLUSHES but never COMMITS looks correct in tests and is dead in production.**
  `upsert_pr_binding` (WS-P2.1) flushed and returned; the HTTP response carried the right values,
  because the ORM hands back the instance it is holding, while the row was discarded when the
  request-scoped session closed. Ten unit tests passed — they assert in-session, where the flush is
  visible. Request entry points in this repo OWN their transaction and must `session.commit()`
  (see `claim_unit`, `requeue_unit`, `record_observation`); functions invoked INSIDE another
  transaction (`arm_verification_head`, called from the SUBMIT transition) must never commit. A
  test that asserts persistence must `expire_all()` and re-read, or it is asserting that a call
  returned an object.
- **A test fixture calling a service is not evidence the service has a caller.** WS-P2.1's PR-binding
  writers had no production call site at all: every reference in the approved plan was a test. The
  binding table was never written, the reconciliation runner (which discovers PRs to poll FROM those
  rows) had nothing to poll, and AC-001/AC-002 detection was never reached — silent, not merely
  blind, since `skipped_correlations` never incremented either. Green unit tests said nothing. When
  adding a service that another subsystem READS, grep for its production caller before believing it
  works — and prefer a drill that drives the public API, which is what actually caught this.
